Mushroom Classification with fastai

Picking up wild mushrooms is an exciting pastime but it can be dangerous if you pick and attempt to eat wrong kind of mushrooms. So companion app may help. Note that in the current state this classifier is not yet ready to be your mushroom picking guide - hopefully soon.

Right now this classifier is trained with 4 classes. 3 edible: Penny Bun (белый гриб), Brown Cap (подберёзовик) and Saffron milk cap (рыжик) and 1 poisonous: Amanita (мухомор).
